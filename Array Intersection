You have been given two integer arrays/list(ARR1 and ARR2) of size N and M, respectively. You need to print their intersection; An intersection for this problem can be defined when both the arrays/lists contain a particular value or to put it in other words, when there is a common value that exists in both the arrays/lists.
Note :
Input arrays/lists can contain duplicate elements.

The intersection elements printed would be in the order they appear in the first array/list(ARR1)

Sample Input 1 :
1
4
2 6 1 2
5
1 2 3 4 2
Sample Output 1 :
2 1 2

CODE-
void intersection(int *input1, int *input2, int size1, int size2)
{
    int i,j,INT_MIN=-2147483647;
    for(i=0;i<size1;i++)
    {
        for(j=0;j<size2;j++)
        if(input1[i]==input2[j])
        {
            cout<<input1[i]<<" ";
        input2[j]=INT_MIN;
        break;
        }
    }
}
